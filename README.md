   ```

2. **Enter when prompted**: The app will ask for your key if not found

3. **Command line** (for scripts):
   ```bash
   GROK_API_KEY="your-key" python main.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"API key required"**: Make sure you have a valid Grok API key
- **Connection errors**: Check your internet connection
- **Import errors**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
